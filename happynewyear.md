# 🎉 Happy New Year 2026! CF-Tool Browser Mode is Here!

Dear Codeforces Community,

As we bid farewell to an amazing 2025 and welcome the exciting possibilities of 2026, I'm thrilled to announce a significant update to **cf-tool** that brings a powerful new way to interact with Codeforces from your command line!

## ✨ What's New?

**cf-tool now supports Browser Mode!** 🚀

After Cloudflare tightened its protection, traditional command-line tools faced challenges accessing Codeforces. Today, we're proud to introduce a solution that leverages your browser's authenticated session through the power of browser automation.

### 🎯 Key Achievement: Parse & Submit POC Complete

The core functionality is now **fully working**:

- ✅ **`cf parse`** - Fetch problem test cases with ease
  - Supports both old (`<br>`) and new (`<div>`) HTML formats
  - Automatically handles multi-line inputs correctly
  - Clean, formatted test case files

- ✅ **`cf submit`** - Submit your code directly from CLI
  - Automatic problem selection (with case-insensitive support)
  - Language selection
  - Real-time submission monitoring
  - All powered by your browser's authenticated session

## 🔧 How It Works

We've integrated with **[mcp-chrome](https://github.com/hangwin/mcp-chrome/)**, an innovative Chrome extension that exposes the Chrome DevTools Protocol through MCP (Model Context Protocol). This means cf-tool can now:
- Bypass Cloudflare protections
- Use your existing login session
- Perform actions just like you would in a browser
- All from the comfort of your terminal!

## 🚀 Quick Start

**1. Install the browser extension:**
```bash
# Install mcp-chrome-bridge
npm install -g @hangwin/mcp-chrome-bridge

# Start the bridge
mcp-chrome-bridge
```

**2. Verify installation:**
```bash
cf mcp-ping  # Should return: ✅ MCP Chrome Server is running
cf mocka     # Should open Chrome and navigate to Codeforces
```

**3. Start coding:**
```bash
cf parse 2122d    # Fetch test cases
cf submit         # Submit your solution
```

## 🎮 Demo

Here's a quick example of the new parse and submit workflow:

```bash
$ cf parse 2122 d
[INFO ] ✓ Browser mode enabled
[INFO ] Extracted 1 sample(s)
Parsed d with 1 samples.

$ cd cf/contest/2122/d
$ cf gen    # Generate code from template
$ vim d.cpp # Write your solution
$ cf test   # Test locally
[INFO ] All test cases passed! ✅

$ cf submit
[INFO ] Selecting problem: d (converted to: D)
[INFO ] Code submitted successfully via browser
✅ Submitted
```

## 🙏 Acknowledgments

This update wouldn't be possible without:
- The **[mcp-chrome](https://github.com/hangwin/mcp-chrome/)** project for providing the browser automation bridge
- The **[cf-tool](https://github.com/xalanq/cf-tool)** original author (@xalanq) for creating this amazing tool
- The **Codeforces community** for your continued support and feedback
- Everyone who contributed, tested, and provided feedback during development

## 🌟 What's Next?

This is a POC (Proof of Concept) release. We've successfully demonstrated that parse and submit work flawlessly. Looking ahead, we're planning:
- Enhanced configuration options
- Automated installation scripts
- More comprehensive testing
- Additional features based on community feedback
